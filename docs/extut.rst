Examples and Tutorials
======================
Examples and tutorials are maintained in the
`examples-pse <https://github.com/IDAES/examples-pse>`_ repository on Github.
You can install them from within an IDAES installation by running 
``idaes get-examples`` in a command-line shell.
This command has a number of options for choosing where to place and install the
download. After installation, open the `notebook_index.ipynb` notebook with
Jupyter or JupyterLab to see a menu of available Jupyter notebooks.

You can also browse the source code and static (pre-generated) Jupyter Notebooks on the
`tutorial documentation pages <https://examples-pse.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
