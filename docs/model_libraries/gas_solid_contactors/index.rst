Gas Solid Contactors IDAES Model Library
============================================

This specialized application library contains a suite of generic advanced models that are applicable to gas-solid processes. The axially discretized models are one dimensional, with two phases (gas and solid). The models capture the gas-solid interaction between the phases is described through reaction, mass
and heat transfer.
