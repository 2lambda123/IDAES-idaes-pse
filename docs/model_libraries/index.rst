IDAES Model Libraries
=====================

The IDAES toolset contains a number of libraries of models for different application areas. All models within these libraries are built upon the core IDAES modeling framework, but are specialsied for the needs of different applications. In many cases these models can be used together in the same flowsheet, however some appllications may make specific assumptions whcih are not compatable with other application libraries.
