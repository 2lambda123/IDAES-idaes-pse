========

The section describes the recommended workflow for the IDAES framework. Users are encouraged 
to follow these best practices in order to efficiently create reliable and accurate models.

Examples of this workflow are provided in the 
:ref:`tutorials<user_guide/learning_materials/index:Learning Materials>`.

(Planning to include a figure that shows the following steps with active links: importing IDAES modules, creating 
flowsheets, scaling, specifying, initializing, optimizing, analyzing)
