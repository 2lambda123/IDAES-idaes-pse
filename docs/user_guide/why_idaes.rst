Why IDAES
=========

The National Energy Technology Laboratory's Institute for the Design of Advanced Energy Systems
(IDAES) is a powerful and versatile computational platform offering next-generation engineering 
capabilities for optimizing the design, operation, and management of innovative chemical 
process and energy systems beyond current constraints on complexity, uncertainty, and scales 
ranging from materials to process to market.

The IDAES Computational Platform was conceived in 2016 to specifically address the gaps between 
state-of-the-art simulation packages, such as Aspen Plus®, gPROMS, ProSim, PRO/II®, and general 
algebraic modeling languages (AMLs), such as GAMS, AMPL, and AIMMS.
 
Major strengths of commercial simulation packages are their libraries of unit models and 
thermo-physical properties. However, such simulation packages often have difficulty optimizing 
flowsheets and have limited support for incorporating models of non-standard, dynamic units, 
such as solids handling, and uncertainty quantification. On the other hand, AMLs are eminently 
flexible and readily support large-scale optimization, but considerable work is required to 
construct process models, which are often only useful for a one-time application. 

The IDAES Computational Platform represents an innovative approach for the design and 
optimization of chemical and energy processes by integrating an extensible, equation-oriented 
process model library with the Pyomo Python-based algebraic modeling language (AML). Built 
specifically to enable rigorous large-scale mathematical optimization, the framework includes 
capabilities for conceptual design, steady-state and dynamic optimization, multi-scale modeling, 
uncertainty quantification, and the automated development of thermodynamic, physical property, 
and kinetic sub-models from experimental data.
