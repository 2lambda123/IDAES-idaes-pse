Phase Equilibrium Formulations
==============================

Phase equilibrium and separation is a key part of almost all chemical processes, and also represent some of the most complex and non-linear constraints in a model, especially when dealing with systems which may cross phase boundaries. As such, good formulations of these constraints is key to a robust and tractable model.

To assist users with formulating the phase equilibrium constraints in their models, the IDAES Generic Property Package Framework contains a library of different formulations for phase equilibrium.
