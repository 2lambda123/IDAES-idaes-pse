Sample Models and Flowsheets
============================

Below are Jupyter Notebooks that have been rendered as HTML. You can also
run these notebooks "live" using the ``jupyter notebook`` command.

* `Simple unit model with a pressure changer <examples/simple_pressure_changer.html>`_
* `Simple flowsheet setup with heat exchangers <examples/simple_hx_flowsheet_01.html>`_
* `Simple flowsheet with a Gibbs reactor <examples/gibbs_methane.html>`_
* `Smooth Extension for Cubic Equations of State <examples/smooth_cubic_extension.html>`_
