Introduction to IDAES Models
============================

The IDAES Toolkit, based on `Python <https://python.org>`_ and `Pyomo <https://pyomo.org>`_, aims to provide multi-scale,
simulation-based, open source computational tools and models to support the design, analysis, optimization, scale-up, operation and troubleshooting of innovative, advanced fossil energy systems.

See the main `IDAES web site <https://idaes.org>`_ for more information about the project.
