Introduction
------------
The Downcomer model consist of a simple pipe model (or a set of pipes). Where, the inlet stream is the Drum outlet and the outlet stream connects with the WaterWall (section 1).
The model simply calculates the pressure change due to friction and gravity, which involves the calculation of fluid velocity, Reynolds number, and friction factor (using Darcyâ€™s correlation). 

Model inputs (variable name):

* inlet stream (flow_mol, enth_mol, pressure)
* number of downcomer pipes (number_downcomers) same as Drum model
* height of the tubes (height)
* inner diameter of the tubes (diameter)
* heat duty (heat_duty), heat_duty = 0 if adiabatic

Model Outputs:

* outlet stream (flow_mol, enth_mol, pressure)
* pressure change (deltaP) due to gravity and friction


Degrees of Freedom
------------------

By specifying the inlet conditions and downcomer dimensions, the model will be fully specified. Things that are frequently fixed are two of:

* inlet state vars (generally flow_mol, enth_mol, pressure)
* heat_duty to the downcomer
* number_downcomers, height, diameter

Constraints
-----------

The main constraints in the model calculate the pressure drop, which is given by deltaP_friction and deltaP_gravity. 

Pressure drop:

.. math::
  \Delta P = \Delta P_{friction} + \Delta P_{gravity}

Friction:

.. math::
  \Delta P_{friction} = f (Friction_{factor}, \rho_{liquid}, V, diameter)
  
Friction factor (Darcy's correlation'):

.. math::
  Friction_{factor} = \frac{0.3164}{Re^{0.25}}

deltaP gravity:

.. math::
  \Delta P_{gravity} = \rho_{liquid} * acceleration_{gravity} * height

Reynolds number:

.. math:: Re = \frac{tube_{di} V \rho}{\mu}


where:

* Re : Reynolds number (liquid)
* V: fluid velocity (m/s, liquid)
* :math:`\rho_{liquid}`: mass density of liquid (kg/m3)

Dynamic Model
-------------

The dynamic model version of the downcomer section model can be constructed by selecting dynamic=True and hold_up=True. 
If dynamic = True, the energy accumulation and material accumulation holdups are constructed. Therefore, a dynamic initialization method has been developed `set_initial_conditions` to initialize the holdup terms.
