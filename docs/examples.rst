Examples
========

The IDAES PSE software includes a number of example scripts and Jupyter Notebooks.
They are maintained the repository https://github.com/IDAES/examples-pse on Github,
and the online documentation
can be found at https://examples-pse.readthedocs.io/ . This documentation includes
browsable versions of the Jupyter Notebooks.

You can view and run the examples locally, but this requires that you have
installed the IDAES PSE toolkit. See the installation instructions for details.
