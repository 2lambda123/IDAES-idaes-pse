Examples
========

The IDAES PSE software includes a number of example scripts and Jupyter Notebooks.
They are maintained the repository https://github.com/IDAES/examples-pse on Github,
and the online documentation
can be found at https://examples-pse.readthedocs.io/ . This documentation includes
browsable versions of the Jupyter Notebooks.

You can install the examples from within an IDAES installation by running 
``idaes get-examples`` in a command-line shell.  
This requires that you have
installed the IDAES PSE toolkit. See the installation instructions for details.
