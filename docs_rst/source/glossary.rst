    API
        Acronym for "Application Programming Interface", this is the
        set of functions used by an external program to invoke the
        functionality of a library or application. For IDAES, it usually
        refers to Python functions and classes/methods in a Python module.
        By analogy, the APIs are to the IDAES library what a steering wheel,
        gearshift and pedals are to a car.
