Developer Documentation
=======================
This section of the documentation is intended for developers, either external or
internal to the project. It is necessarily more detailed, more cutting-edge, and
somewhat less polished than the user-facing documentation. Some of this material
is also tutorial in nature, as it is intended to be a resource for the IDAES
developer community.
